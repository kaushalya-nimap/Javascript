        console.log(double(5)); // 10
        //bind is used when you want to create a new function for later use with a specific this.
        // Common Use Cases:
        // Borrowing methods.
        // Working with dynamic arguments.
        // Controlling this in event handlers or callbacks.
        // Function currying.
